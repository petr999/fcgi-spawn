FCGI::Spawn is used to serve CGI-like applications as a FastCGI process
manager. Besides the features the FCGI::ProcManager posess itself, the
FCGI::Spawn is targeted as web server admin understandable instance for
building the own fastcgi server with copy-on-write memory sharing among
forks and with single input parameters like socket path and processes
number. Another thing to mention is that it is able to execute/do() any file
pointed by Web server. So we have the daemon that separates the task of
developers (admins, users, etc.) within the same processes set making the
soultion a memory-effective.
